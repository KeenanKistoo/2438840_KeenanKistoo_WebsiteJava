          JavaScript Implementation and Reflection
        </h2>
        <p class="design-text">
          I am not particularly proud of the work that I have achieved for this
          submission. The major JavaScript features are how I carry my
          navigation bar across each page and also how I generate my blog posts.
          I have also added a filter function to my blog page.
        </p>
        <p class="design-text">
          My inital idea was to have a pop-up page that will display my blog
          posts without loading into a new page. I tried several methods but I
          could not do it in time. My lack of ability to stop and move on to
          different tasks have played a major role in my downfall for this
          submission. Due to this and other factors, my responsive design could
          not be completed in time for submission. I needed to ensure that all
          my formatting was completed before I made my website responsive and I
          have failed to do this. This is not how I imagined this assignment
          would go however, I have to do extremely well in the exam to make up
          for my mistakes.
