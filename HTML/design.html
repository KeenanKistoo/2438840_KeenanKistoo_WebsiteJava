          It took five iterations before I decided on a wireframe that best
          suited the website I was trying to create.

            This was my first iteration. Honestly, I do not know what I was
            thinking. If I remember correctly, we had just completed a
            discussion on Figma, and other wireframing tools. This was probably
            my first attempt using the tools.

            This wireframe was more aligned. This was the first iteration of my
            homepage that I actually coded. The design goal was to have all the
            information about my website present on the homepage to ensure that
            users know what they can expect.

            This is an iteration from a website that I came across when
            researching more on homepage wireframes. I decided against it as the
            "insert-quote" section was filled with sign up information on the
            website example. I felt that trying to fill my homepage with random
            words would be pointless for the user.

            This was my favourite wireframe that I have completed. It had all
            the different elements that I wanted for my homepage. For my inital
            submission (Assignment 1), I was not fully comfortable with
            HTML/CSS, so I decided against complicated things further and tried
            to keep it simple. For Assignment 3 (JavaScript submission), I
            changed my idea entirely. It will be illustrated below.
